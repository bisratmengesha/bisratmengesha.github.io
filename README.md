## Description
This was an MIT xPRO assignment. We had to create a portfolio page that showcased our bio and three front-end exercises that we completed during the course using a bootstrap framework. In addition to using the bootstrap CSS, I added a grid layout to each page and implemented new fonts and functionalities. As a first-time coder, this was fun to explore.
# How to run
The website launches on the homepage. You can see the the three projects through the navbar.
# Roadmap of future improvements
As this was my very first portfolio, it can accomodate a lot of improvements such as, adding icons and content.
